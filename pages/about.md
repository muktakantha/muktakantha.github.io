I'm Muktakantha Azad Ramnath Das. 
This is my creative & expressive frontier for my views. 

My name owes to the personalities & cultures that shaped my outlook towards life. Muktakantha, the title of the website & my first name is a Samskrit honorific or title which means, 'the one with the free voice'. Azad pays homage to the brave Chandrasekhar Azad who fought for his own principles & hailed a martyr. Ramnath pays respect to Ramnath Goenka, founder & editor of The Indian Express; he set a groundbreaking example of powerful & fearless journalism amidst political lobbying. Finally, Das pays a tribute to the author Manoj Das who style of writing & story-telling is one which I consider to be the best.
