```
A school is a place of learning.
A place of ideation & innovation.
A place of enrichment & education.
But sometimes we forget the basic need of it all.
```
  This is a honest... rant on schools.

  Schools usually have a closed administrative structure.
By closed I refer to how the main stakeholders in a school, the students, are often left out of any & all decision making.
Some schools have a cabinett to alleviate this.
But cabinets are more dysfunctional than monarchies.
