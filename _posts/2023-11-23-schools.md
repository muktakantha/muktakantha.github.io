```
A school is a place of learning.
A place of ideation & innovation.
A place of enrichment & education.
But sometimes we forget the basic need of it all.
```
  This is a honest... rant on schools.

  Schools usually have a closed administrative structure.
By closed I refer to how the main stakeholders in a school, the students, are often left out of any & all decision making.
Some schools have a cabinet to alleviate this.
But cabinets are more dysfunctional than monarchies.

A school cabinet structure usually has the principal or headmaster at its apex.
Then follow the house coordinators & house teachers.
At its bottom we have the representatives.
Here, effective communication between & amongst all the levels & their constituent members is crucial for good & just governance.

This, however is better said than done.
Many systematic issues plague the working of the cabinet which defeats its purpose entirely; to serve as the students' forum.
