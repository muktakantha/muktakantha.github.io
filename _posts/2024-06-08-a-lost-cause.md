A lost cause
when serendipity gets awry

life feels diabetic
people are distant

scared to hurt feelings
hurting yourself the most

dying inside
blooming no getting stomped out

why blame
she wont budge

alls your fault
when alls worse with all

why me?
if not my questions

call me curious
but my curiosity rubbish?

multidisciplinary
but not multi-empathy?

tark shastra yes
tarq i'm annoying?

why all this?
science & education or just mental torture

alls fun & games
even pure pain

no human connection
no passionate research

cant spare 5 seconds
but its all rubbish

its all rubbish right
burn it all

no new viewpoints
no student excitement

burn it all in anger or pain
because they dont affect you, destroy!

no second thought or words
still you're frank & thats good

why do all this
lifes mass wasted

advice constructive?
oh never; depressing it is

just end all this
no ones affected

we're soldiers
whose troops cant even fking coordinate

yeah we're soldiers
walking in marsh with lead weights

dont pollute the earth
but pollute its kids minds

this is policy
policing curiosity

no repercussions
no face discussions

all on opinion
all on made up life

this is it
thanks!
